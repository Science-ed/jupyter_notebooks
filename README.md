This repository contains some scripts written by me from time to time


One of the scripts on Anscombe's quartets is available as a Jupyter notebook downloaded as an html file. This file may not render properly on GotHub. Should it not render properly, you can click this link:- [Anscombes quartets](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ag999git/jupyter_notebooks/blob/master/Anascombes_quartets_FINAL.html)
